Audio-Digest-MP3 version 0.10
=============================

Sometimes you want to know if you have duplicate MP3 files on your disks. But
as soon as you start editing the ID3 tags, the file contents changes, and you
can no longer trust a plain MD5 checksum on the file, nor the file size, to
compare them.

This module scans the MP3 file, only including the audio stream (undecoded!) to
calculate the message digest.

While it scans, it compiles more metadata about the file, such as playing time,
either in seconds or as formatted string, bitrate (in kbits/sec), stream size
in bytes, and whether the file is a CBR or a VBR file.

In short: lots of info that you can use to compare MP3 files, but excluding any
info coming out of the ID3 tags.
